## 8 - A graphic editor

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/9)

My dream is to build a graphic Audio Graph with a mouse.
We will drag and drop Audio nodes to the graph, and draw the channels between them.

The nodes attributs will be specified by menu.

We will have a test/pause/resume button so that the Audio Graph designer will have an audio preview of how the sound is processed.

This milestone is probably not useful. But it will be funny to do it.

This is milestone #8. I will probably be dead before reaching it :-( .
