## 3 - Taudio on Blazor

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/4)

Blazor is Microsoft`s framework to build Web App with C#.
This framework is similar to Flutter Web.
Blazor compile to webasm.

We do not expect more problems than with milestone #1 : the purpose of this step is to build an interface
between C# and Javascript instead of Dart and Javascript.

In this milestone, we will code most of the W3C and Mozilla examples as Blazor Examples.

We may skip this milestone if we decide that we are only interested by Flutter and the knowledge of other frameworks will be to hard for us.
We may also delay this milestone after #5 (after the impmentation of TaudioStreams on Flutter iOS and Flutter Android).
