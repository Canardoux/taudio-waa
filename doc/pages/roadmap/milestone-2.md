## 2 - Taudio Player/Recorder on Flutter

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/3)

This milestone is probably very simple. Everything will be coded in Flutter with pure Dart.
The goal is to offer a very high API for major simple graphs. For example a MP3 player.
With this API, the developer will not have to build himself/herself his/her graphs.
The API will be similar to Flutter Sound or Just Audio, but not identical.

In this milestone we will port the Flutter Sound examples.

This step will simplify the migration from Flutter Sound on Web, which is actually not very good.

We may skip this milestone if we decide that Taudio is only a port of Web Audio API on flutter but we do not want to be a Flutter Sound replacement.
We may also delay this mileston after #5 (after the impmentation of TaudioStreams on Flutter iOS and Flutter Android).
