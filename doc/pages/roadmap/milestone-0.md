## 0 - Project launch

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/1)

This step is not about coding, but about doing things which are required to launch the project

We will :

- Setup a Git repo
- Choose a documentation tool
- Setup the documentation. It can be:
  - Jekyll (same as Flutter Sound and compatible with dartdoc)
  - Notion.so (which is close source)
  - Hugo
  - Gatsby
  - Docusaurus
  - Git Book (which is close source)
  - ... other ...
- Choose a Project Management tool (if any)
- Choose an Issue Tracker tool (if any)
- Define an architecture
- Setup all the examples from W3C and Mozilla in pure Javascript

Porting the examples in Javascript is just copy and past from W3C and Mozilla.
This is useful because :

- We will get familiar with Web Audio API
- We will have a regular implementation in pure Javascript of what we want to achieve with other frameworks not Javascript
