## 1 - Taudio Streams on Flutter Web

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/2)

This milestone is probably not very difficult.
The goal is just to offer the W3C API to Flutter Web.
We do not expect many problems : we will probably just implement the interface to call Javascript from Dart.

The documentation will be very simple : we do not want to rewrite the Mozilla documentation which is really very good.
Probably the documentation will only be the correspondance between Dart and Javascript.
This documentation will be in the Dart code itself. No need to write several Markdown documentation as we did for Flutter Sound.

In this milestone, we will code most of the W3C and Mozilla examples as Flutter Examples.
