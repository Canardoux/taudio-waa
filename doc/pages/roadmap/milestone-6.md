## 6 - Taudio Streams for Desktop

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/Canardoux/taudio/projects/7)

A port of our library on desktops is something that we probably want. Specially on GNU/Linux.

We can port Taudio on:

- Microsoft MAUI
- Flutter Desktop
- Electron
- ...

We will have to make a choice. We cannot support all the existing frameworks existing in 2022.
We may also declare that we are not interested by using Taudio on desktops.
